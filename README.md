Reflection
For this project, I ended with a final product slightly different from what I had expected. Initially, I planned on using the Google Books API to sort through different categories and return 5 book recommendations. The targeted users for this project are people who are indecisive and want quick and easy book recommendations. 
After about a week or two of the Google books API, I ended up realizing that it was extremely difficult to sort through by genre (a call for "fiction" books would return a list with "Genesis" on it, which is highly controversial). Thus, I ended up switching APIs to the New York Books API, which had book lists based on categories. 
With the New York Books API, I looped through 3 book lists to return 5 books based on the weather input from the user. One of the challenges with this was figuring out how to randomize my list. I initially had used the random.choice command, but that would return repeat books. I had to use the random.sample command so that the program would return a list that did not include two of one book.
 
Another challenge was that I had multiple technical difficulties; my python program loaded very slowly, so it was difficult to make edits because it took so long for the program to load. Iâ€™ve also been experiencing other technical issues with python not running certain files; a lot of technical issues took up some time with the project, which made it a bit more challenging to work on the project.
 
Overall, this was a project where I learned a lot about incorporating flask into a program to build a webpage. Looking back, I wish I had built everything on one html page instead of cycling between two so that users could quickly and easily change input.
